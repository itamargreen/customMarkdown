So, the time has come for us to start another [Topic Challenge](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/207/topic-challenges). There are a few changes this time around!

### Time frame
8/12, 0:00 $\rightarrow$ 23:59, 8/21 (times in UTC).

### Challenge: Topic Tag

We use [tag:differentiation] as a base, but focus on the techniques that increase the use of [kinesthetic learning strategies](http://www.kinestheticlearningstrategies.com/) in the instruction set. Not just examples of activities (there's plenty of those to choose from on [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/)), but how to actually integrate it into the whole of the teaching, and the testing.

### Entering the challenge

For a question to be entered, three conditions must be met:

1. It **must** be posted *within* the specified time frame. (which means that posting it before or after doesn't get it entered).
1. It **has** to be tagged with [tag:self-learning] (I think this is fairly reasonable).
2. You **have** to add an answer to this meta post.*The answer is your entry ticket, and should follow the format outlined at the end of this post*.

And a fourth option to make it visible from the question page: You can add a comment to your question: `*This question has been entered into [The Being Selfish challenge question contest](https://cseducators.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/275/topic-challenge-02-being-selfish).*`

### Further notes

Edits made after the end of the specified time frame and the final judging may disqualify the question.

### Question judging

1. 10 points per upvote on the question itself.
2. 3 points per answer that is created, and 1 points per upvote on any answer.  *So, if an answer is created that gets 3 upvotes, it will be worth 6 points to a question’s overall score).  Self-answers will not earn the question points, but may still gain upvote points in this category*. (which means that interesting questions which attract answers rank higher than those who bring relatively few answers)
3. Each judge may award up to 35 points based on *how much of an exemplar the question is for the tag*, and up to 5 additional points for *any other considerations* (such as great writing, etc).


### Structure of submission answers (For when you add an answer to this post)

---

The format of answers to this post should be like this:

`## Question link`<sup>1</sup>
`<br>`<br>
`tags:` `[tag:self-learning]`,... (here you write the tags your question has)


<br>

### If you win

The winner will be announced when the judging period ends.
The winner of the contest gets declared Ruler of the Tag and Generally All-Around Cool Person! If enough people enter the contest, SE may also add to this prize a Stack Exchange t-shirt! So get asking, and you might get some Stack Exchange Swag.


### Good luck to everyone
